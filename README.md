#THIS IS JUST THE FRONTEND

# Practice Project – First Steps in Web Development

This website was created as a personal exercise — my first real foray into web development. It marks my initial experience working with HTML, JavaScript, and the fundamental concepts of building and connecting a frontend with a backend.

The project has no intended utility. It's not designed to solve a problem or serve users. Instead, it’s a sandbox: a place to experiment, break things, and learn by doing.

**Purpose:** To get hands-on experience, not to deliver a finished product.
